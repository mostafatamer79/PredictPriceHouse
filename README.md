# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models based on features such as location, size, and amenities. The model can be used by real estate businesses and individuals to estimate property values and make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw data for model input.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data trends and correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Built models using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using metrics such as RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
